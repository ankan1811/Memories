## Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB you'll learn how to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

It helped me to have a strong understanding of how the MERN Stack works.
Styling has been done using material-UI.
